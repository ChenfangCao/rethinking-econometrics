## `ts` objects and `ts` function

A time series is stored in a `ts` object in R:

 - a list of numbers
 - information about times those numbers were recorded.

### Example

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Year &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Observation &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2012 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 123 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2013 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 39 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2014 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 78 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2015 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 52 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2016 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 110 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

```r
y &lt;- ts(c(123,39,78,52,110), start=2012)
```

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

.pull-left[

For observations that are more frequent than once per year, add a `frequency` argument.

E.g., monthly data stored as a numerical vector `z`:

```r
y &lt;- ts(z, frequency=12, start=c(2003, 1))
```
]
.pull-right[

`ts(data, frequency, start)`

####Type of data 
|frequency|start|example|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Annual|1 |1995|
|Quarterly|4|`c(1995,2)`|
|Monthly|12|`c(1995,9)`|
|Daily|7 or 365.25|  1 or c(1995,234)|
|Weekly| 52.18| c(1995,23)|
|Hourly|24 or 168 or 8,766  | 1|
|Half-hourly|48 or 336 or 17,532 | 1|

## Rethinking econometrics: 
### `the importance of simulation`

- Simulation of random variables is important in applied statistics for several reasons. 
- .larger[First], we use probability models to mimic variation in the world, and the tools of simulation can help us better
understand how this variation plays out.

.blockquote[
Patterns of randomness are notoriously contrary to normal human thinking—our brains don’t seem to be able to do a good job understanding that random swings will be present in the short term but average out in the long run—and in many cases simulation is a big help in training our intuitions about averages and variation.

* Financial time series processes considered in this course:
* Return series
* Financial statement information
* Volatility processes
* Extreme events
* Multivariate series
  ]

.pull-right[
## Why assume normal asset returns?
* Normality assumption allows for asset returns properties to be tractable.
* Tractable mean and variance
  * They provide information about the long-term return and risk, respectively.
* Tractable symmetrical properties
  * Symmetry has important implications in holding short and long financial positions in risk management.
* Tractable kurtosis properties 
  * Kurtosis is related to volatility forecasting, efficiency in estimation and tests,etc.

1. The lower bound of a simple return is -1, but a normal distribution has no lower bound.
2. Multiperiod simple returns `\(R_it[k]\)` is not normally distributed as it is the *product* of one-period returns.

### Should we care if asset returns are normal distributed variables?

.large[
- In regressions the assumption of normality of model errors is one of the least important
- For the purpose of estimating the regression line it is barely important at all
- Diagnostics of normality of errors is not recommended unless the model is being used to predict individual data points.
]

class: middle

### Should we care if asset returns are normal distributed variables?


- If the distribution of errors is of interest, perhaps because of predictive goals, this should be distinguished from the distribution of the data, `\(y\)`.
- **A regression model does not assume or require that predictors are normally distributed**
- Furthermore, the normal distribution on the outcome refers to the regression errors, not the raw data.
- Depending on the structure of the predictors, it is possible for data `\(y\)` to be far from normally distributed even when coming from a linear regression model.
- See Gelman et al., (2020) Chapter 11 for more detail

## Null (.acid[ or Nil]) hypothesis significant testing


* Null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) are models.
* We assume an underlying data story with distributional properties which then allows us to create p-values based on null hypothesis.
* In practice they are often misused to create 'bright line' acceptance or rejection decision about underlying theoretical questions.
* In applied statistics their misuse is well understood

.salt[and]

`$$r_{k} = c_k/c_0$$`

* `\(r_1\)` indicates how successive values of  `\(y\)`  relate to each other
* `\(r_2\)` indicates how  `\(y\)` values two periods apart relate to each other
* `\(r_k\)` is *almost* the same as the sample correlation between `\(y_t\)` and `\(y_{t-k}\)`.

## Financial Data Forecastability

  - Predictability of an event or quantity depends on several factors
  1. How well we understand the factors that contribute to it
  2. How much data are available
  3. Whether the forecast can affect the thing we are trying to forecast

## Prediction and EMH
  - Crudely, the efficent market hypothesis (EMH) implies that returns from speculative assets are *unforecastable*
  - The overpowering logic of the EMH is:
    - **If returns are forecastable,there should exist a money machine producing unlimited wealth**
- Based on the random walk theory change in price are defined as white noise as follows:
`\begin{align*}
p_t=p_{t-1} + a_t \\
p_t-p_{t-1} = a_t \\
\text{where}
